go-mode-1.4.0 (???)

 * Fix minor bug in fontification.

 * Use unwind-protect in gofmt, ensuring that temporary files will be
   removed in all cases.

 * Improve go-remove-unused-imports: don't fail to remove unused
   imports because of compilation errors in other files.

 * Add new functions for jumping to various parts of function
   declarations:

    - go-goto-arguments
    - go-goto-docstring
    - go-goto-function
    - go-goto-function-name
    - go-goto-return-values
    - go-goto-method-receiver

 * Add new customizable variable go-packages-function, which allows
   choosing between different ways of finding installed packages.
   Currently, go-packages-native (the default) and go-packages-go-list
   are provided.

 * Automatically detect if goimports is used instead of gofmt and pass
   the -srcdir flag, enabling support for vendoring.

 * Add new customizable variable gofmt-args, a list of strings that
   will be passed to gofmt as additional arguments. Primarily this
   allows using the -s flag with gofmt.

   metadata. This version fixes that.

   godef command.
