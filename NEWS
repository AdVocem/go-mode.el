go-mode-1.4.0 (???)

 * Fix minor bug in fontification.

 * Use unwind-protect in gofmt, ensuring that temporary files will be
   removed in all cases.

 * Improve go-remove-unused-imports: don't fail to remove unused
   imports because of compilation errors in other files.

 * Add new functions for jumping to various parts of function
   declarations:

    - go-goto-arguments
    - go-goto-docstring
    - go-goto-function
    - go-goto-function-name
    - go-goto-return-values
    - go-goto-method-receiver

 * Add new customizable variable go-packages-function, which allows
   choosing between different ways of finding installed packages.
   Currently, go-packages-native (the default) and go-packages-go-list
   are provided.

 * Automatically detect if goimports is used instead of gofmt and pass
   the -srcdir flag, enabling support for vendoring.

 * Add new customizable variable gofmt-args, a list of strings that
   will be passed to gofmt as additional arguments. Primarily this
   allows using the -s flag with gofmt.

 * Add detection of GOPATH, Godep, wgo and gb. A new non-interactive
   function go-guess-gopath will try a list of functions
   (go-guess-gopath-functions) to detect a suitable value for GOPATH.
   A new interactive command go-set-project uses the result of
   go-guess-gopath to actually set GOPATH. This interactive function
   could be used from inside a projectile-switch-project-hook,
   directory variables or some other way of invoking per-project code.

 * Add variable godoc-command, which allows choosing between using
   godoc and go doc. It defaults to go doc, which differs from prior
   versions which always used godoc.

 * Add variable godoc-use-completing-read, which allows turning on or
   off the completion of import paths in godoc. This is only really
   useful when using godoc instead of go doc, and thus defaults to
   off.

 * Fix parsing of test output in compilation-mode for new versions of
   Emacs. It's probably broken in older versions now.

 * Add support for electric-indent-mode and only reindent for closing
   parens, not colons, commas or equal signs.

 * Avoid warnings by the byte compiler -- Use cl-lib instead of cl,
   and utilize a macro to conditionally compile fallback code.

go-mode-1.3.1 (2015-07-03)

 * The 1.3.0 release forgot to update the version in the package
   metadata. This version fixes that.

go-mode-1.3.0 (2015-05-03)

 * Add a new minor mode godoc-mode, used instead of view-mode when
   displaying godoc output.

go-mode-1.2.1 (2015-04-10)

  * After using godef-jump, don't temporarily mark old buffer as
    active.

go-mode-1.2.0 (2015/03/22):

 * Add a menu for go-mode.

 * Add a new variable go-play-browsw-function that controls the
   behaviour of go-play-region and go-play-buffer.

 * Fix minor bug in fontification.

 * Fix minor bug in go-remove-unused-imports that sometimes prevented
   it from removing unused imports.

go-mode-1.1.0 (2015-02-25):

 * Add a new variable godef-command, allowing customization of the
   godef command.

 * Automatically hide the gofmt error window after fixing errors.

go-mode-1.0.0 (2014-11-28):

 * First release since go-mode was removed from the Go distribution.
