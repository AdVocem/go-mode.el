This is a replacement for the Go mode that comes with the Go
distribution. It fixes several issues and adds new features, such as
movement by functions, like one is used to from other major modes in
emacs.

For a complete list of changes, check the header of go-mode.el.

To use this mode instead of the default one, add it to your load path
and load it instead of the old one. It acts as a direct drop-in
replacement.
